# Test Driven Development Practice

A few very simple tasks I completed using TDD (Test Driven Development) to get more comfortable with the workflow. Made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice). Used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing tool.

## What is TDD

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming approach where you write tests for your code before writing the actual code itself. The process follows a "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass (Green)
3. Clean up and improve the code while keeping tests passing (Refactor)

This makes the programming experience more fun and addictive, increases the quality and readability of code, provinding a documentation of sorts and saves time in the long run by decreasing time spend debugging.

## The Tasks

1. **capitalize** function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. **reverseString** function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. **calculator** object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. **caesarCipher** function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
5. **analyzeArray** function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
